OpenBTS-UMTS requires a configuration database, OpenBTS-UMTS.db.

In an initial installation, OpenBTS-UMTS.db is created from OpenBTS-UMTS.example.sql.

To do that:

sh> sqlite3 OpenBTS-UMTS.db
sqlite3> .read OpenBTS-UMTS.example.sql
sqlite3> .quit


Done!

The installation location of this file will be /etc/OpenBTS/OpenBTS-UMTS.db
BTW: If OpenBTS-UMTS.db already exists, you will need to delete that file before doing this procedure.

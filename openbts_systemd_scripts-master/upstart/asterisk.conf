# asterisk
#
# Upstart control file for the Asterisk PBX
#
# To install, rename this file to 'asterisk' and copy it to /etc/event.d/
# On Debian: copy to /etc/init/
#
# To start asterisk manually:
#     sudo start asterisk
#
# To stop asterisk manually:
#     sudo stop asterisk
#
# Asterisk is started with an "interactive console", though redirected
# to/from /dev/null . The concept of a main console is bad. OTOH, the main
# process should not detach from the console if we work with upstart and
# alike.
#
# The username 'asterisk' is currently hardwired here, and likewise the
# varrundir.
